1.The class FaceDetection accepts image and aws access keys as parameters.
2. When you initialize the class you send these parameters which are stored in the variables. These variables
   are initialized by dunder function __init__ automatically.
3. After you create object, you call the run method through the created object and run method calls face_detection method.
4. The face_detection method reads the image as bytes and boto3 detect_faces api is triggered to get the
    details of the passed image.
5. In response the api gives the details in json format
6. Finally you parse the json response as per the need to extract the desired field.
    Note: This extraction method could be made dynamic but the nature of the data field provided by api
            are not same so had to do manual parsing.
